Documentation
=============

``RfPy`` is a package containing Python tools for calculating teleseismic
receiver functions. Methods are available to plot and post-process 
receiver function data for use in crustal and upper mantle studies. 
Current post processing methods include: H-k stacking,
Harmonic decomposition and CCP imaging. The code uses 
the ``StDb`` package for querying and building a station database 
used in command-line scripts.

.. note::

   ``RfPy`` was written independently of the Python software `rf <https://rf.readthedocs.io>`_,
   although it is possible that some classes and methods defined here might be applied
   to ``rf`` objects, since both are heavily based on `obspy <http://www.obspy.org>`_. The main
   differences between ``RfPy`` and ``rf`` are as follows:

   * ``RfPy`` employs either a Wiener or multitaper spectral deconvolution 
     technique, whereas ``rf`` uses either a water-level 
     spectral deconvolution or a time-domain deconvolution.
   * ``RfData`` objects are used to calculate single-station and single-event receiver 
     functions, whereas ``rf`` can handle multiple stations at once.
